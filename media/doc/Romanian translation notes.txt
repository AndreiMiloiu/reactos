 1. They use only the correct Romanian language diacritics.
 2. They will make a correct translation both grammatically and literally and according to MSDN.
 3. For the user-computer talking they use the long infinitive.
 4. For the computer-user talking they use a formally polite talking.
 5. They avoid the excessive politeness.
 6. It is recommended to use a neutral expression if we do not know the noun gender.
 7. All the accelerators will follow the MSDN's rules, by trying to avoid changing them. We will keep the same XP/2003 (and newer) accelerators.
