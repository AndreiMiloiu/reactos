------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. We use only the correct Romanian language diacritics.
 2. We will make a correct translation both grammatically and literally.
 3. All the accelerators and the translation will follow the MSDN's rules, by trying to avoid changing them. We will keep the same XP/2003 (and newer) accelerators.
 4. The only changes accepted from the MS translations are the typos.
